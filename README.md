#Forge Tutor Mod

##Introduction

This is a personal tutorial for myself so that I can walk through the functionality within Minecraft Forge
and get used to it; hopefully figuring out how to do a lot of things later in the process.

This mod will contain a number of items that will each represent a part of Forge, starting out from Blocks
and ending in the generation of a completely new world (potentially, haven't quite decided yet)

##Licencing

This whole mod has been placed under the Apache 2.0 license of fair use.
